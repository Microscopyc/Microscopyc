"""Microscopyc is a tool to identify and analyze microscopic images,
particularly biological cells.
It contains two modules, one for training, in case users want to add
new categories to identify, and the second module to categorize the user's
images based on the cell type and process the images with an output that
compare size, groupings, morphological differences and cells per pixel for
each category."""
